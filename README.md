# Advanced_Programming_and_Optimization_Algorithms
Projects done in the course of Advanced Programming and Optimization Algorithm from the second year at Mathematical and Computing Sciences for Artificial Intelligence. Everything is done by me :) 

There are 4 Assignment each one having different task which will be clearly described in its own folder.


Jellyfish Project

In this project I had as input a set of images. They may be seen as a series of pictures of a Jellifish moving rightwards.
The main task was to find a way to determine the rightful order, in terms of distance, between the first and all the other pictures.

Projects coming from the second year at Mathematical and Computing Sciences for Artificial Intelligence done by me.

Jellyfish Project

In this project I had as input a set of images. They may be seen as a series of pictures of a Jellifish moving rightwards.
The main task was to find a way to determine the rightful order, in terms of distance, between the first and all the other pictures.
